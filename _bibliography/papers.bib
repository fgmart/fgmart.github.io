abstract = {This paper explores the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) educational tools and curricula for children, describing a spectrum from playful exploration to structured pedagogy. We address three research questions: (RQ1) What themes are revealed in the literature on AI/ML for children? (RQ2) In what ways do the development of AI/ML tools and curricula co-evolve? (RQ3) How does the historical context of the field frame current work on AI/ML for children? We observe a co-evolution of tools and curricula, where researchers build new tools and curriculum developers adopt tools created by others. As tools prove successful, they become widely available and are adopted by a broad range of users. Additionally, we note instances where tool creators take on the role of curriculum developer. Recognizing the need for a clear overview of AI/ML educational resources, we introduce major themes of tools, tool-forward, and curriculum-forward works. These themes are designed to help educators, researchers, and curriculum designers in discerning the fundamental nature and potential applications of resources. By distinguishing tools that are standalone from those integrated into curricula, our framework supports strategic decisions in resource adoption and development. Drawing on the field's history, we outline a continuum of tools and platforms, from constructionist elements to interactive play environments.},

abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) technology rapidly advances and integrates further into everyday life, building AI literacy in children is now more important than ever. AI literacy includes understanding key AI concepts such as search algorithms, which are foundational and have wide-ranging real-world applications. To support curricula that foster AI and computational literacy in K-12 students, we developed a novel, easy-to-use software tool to introduce this foundational topic by teaching two search algorithms to middle school children. We present IntoTheRabbitHole, an interactive web application where users help a rabbit find its carrot to learn about Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS). In this work, our research questions were: (RQ1) Can we develop an engaging and enjoyable web application to teach search algorithms?; (RQ2) Could we find evidence of student learning of Depth First Search and Breadth First Search from using our application?; and (RQ3) How do students compare Depth First Search and Breadth First Search after interacting with IntoTheRabbitHole? We collected both quantitative and qualitative data on student use of IntoTheRabbitHole at an after-school AI program. We found that IntoTheRabbitHole was successful in fostering an understanding of both DFS and BFS. Furthermore, we obtained a statistically significant result showing that interaction with IntoTheRabbitHole led to better performance on a DFS traversal pre- and post-survey item, indicating that many students learned DFS through interaction with our tool.},

abstract = { Culturally responsive pedagogy (CRP) is an important approach for fostering equitable and meaningful learning experiences for students from diverse backgrounds. Teachers bring varied prior knowledge and experiences and may encounter challenges when integrating this pedagogy in teaching CS. This study investigated two teachers’ development of CRP throughout a multiple-year professional learning program within a researcher–practitioner partnership (RPP) project. Multiple data sources were analyzed to examine teachers’ understandings and reported enactments of the six pillars of the Culturally Responsive-Sustaining Computer Science Education Framework. The two cases demonstrated how teachers developed their understandings and diverse ways of enacting CRP in teaching CS. Both teachers consistently prioritized student voice and agency, integrating students’ cultural assets into their curricula by addressing community issues. This longitudinal study offers valuable insights for designing RPPs and professional learning programs to enhance teachers’ understanding and CRP practices in CS education..},

Students see how n-grams are constructed from sentences that they provide to the software. Students can modify the n-value and see its effect on the n-gram that is created. A dynamic diagram helps students grasp the statistical processes and how data and parameter choices influence outcomes. In a study with 48 students from 6th to 8th grade, survey items revealed pre-conceptions, such as equating word prediction functionality with internet searches and overestimating such capabilities. After interaction with our software tool, 31 students recognized n-grams’ dependency on statistical data rather than assuming a cognitive understanding of text. They appreciated the significance of the n parameter in enhancing prediction accuracy. The study suggests the software was effective in helping students developing a probabilistic model of text prediction.},

 abstract={As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to integrate into more aspects of society, equipping younger generations with foundational AI knowledge becomes increasingly critical. This paper presents Word2Vec4Kids (W2V4K), an interactive application designed to familiarize middle school students with word embeddings, a key aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP). W2V4K leverages the Word2Vec model, allowing students to explore word associations, similarity, and vector arithmetic through engaging game modes. The application was tested with 38 middle school students aged 11-14 at a Science Technology Engineering Math (STEM)-focused charter school. Data were collected on students’ interactions with the application, including screen recordings, audio, and survey responses. Results demonstrated that W2V4K effectively introduces NLP concepts to students. Qualitative observations revealed high levels of engagement with students expressing excitement and curiosity about word relationships. As they progressed through the game modes, students showed increasing confidence in predicting word associations, brainstorming relevant words, and connecting the concepts to real-world applications. Quantitative data from post-interaction surveys indicated positive learning outcomes with 44.5% of students achieving perfect scores on concept-related items. Additionally, students demonstrated an ability to critically think about language representation. This study suggests that W2V4K provides an effective and engaging method for introducing NLP concepts to middle school students, contributing to the broader goal of enhancing AI literacy among younger generations.},

 author={Vahedian Movahed*, Saniya and Martin, Fred},
 volume={39},
 DOI={10.1609/aaai.v39i28.35196},
 abstract={The AI Chef Trainer is an educational web app that introduces children to the role of data in machine learning (ML) through the engaging task of recipe recommendation. Initially, students tested the AI Chef’s capabilities by selecting from a list of ingredients to see what the system recommended as possible recipes. After observing the recommendations, they contributed by adding their own recipes—each being a set of ingredients and a corresponding recipe-name—which were used to retrain the model and finally re-tested recipe suggestions. This cyclical process of testing, contributing, retraining, and post-training testing provided students with hands-on experience in how AI systems learn and adapt over time based on new data. We tested our software with middle school students. The results indicated that students recognized the importance of both data quantity and specificity in the training process. 45 of 52 students entered recipes, and 26 of the 52 tested their own recipes using the specific ingredients they entered. Students were introduced to the concept of confidence percentages via the AI recipe suggestions. Even as the primary focus was the role of data in machine learning, the AI Chef Trainer software also served as a window into students’ cultural expression and personal preferences.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing rapidly in our society and is now apparent in our day-to-day lives. With the recent burst of interest in AI, many individuals and children may view AI as something mystic and magical. It is important to demystify and introduce to them how AI is made and works. To address this need, we developed a software application that allows children to specify the parameters used by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. Then students experience how RL is used to train an AI model to play the game "Snake." This software tool was tested with 71 middle school-age students. Here, we describe the design of the TrainYourSnakeAI application, the approach we used to introduce the associated ideas to middle school children, and how we assessed student learning. Qualitative data collected from students are presented and discussed. We surveyed their knowledge of AI before and after using the application. In this work, our research questions were: (RQ1) How can we create an engaging tool to teach reinforcement learning? and (RQ2) Does using our application foster a stronger understanding of reinforcement learning in children? Our findings indicate that students were able to understand the functionality of reward functions and how agents can learn from the environment using the concept of RL. We found that out of the 51 students who were not previously familiar with RL, 40 were able to provide adequate descriptions of RL after using TrainYourSnakeAI.},

abstract = {As initiatives on AI education in K-12 learning contexts continues to evolve, researchers have developed curricula among other resources to promote AI across grade levels. Yet, there is a need for more effort regarding curriculum, tools, and pedagogy, as well as assessment techniques to popularize AI at the middle school level. Drawing on prior work, we created original curriculum activities with innovative use of existing technology, a new computational teaching tool, and a series of approaches and assessments to evaluate students’ engagement with the learning resources. Our curriculum called AI MyData comprises elements of ML and data science infused with ethical orientation. In this article, we describe the novel AI curriculum and further discuss how we engaged students in learning and critiquing AI ethical dilemmas. We gathered data from two pilot studies conducted in the Northeast United States, one Artificial Intelligence Afterschool (AIA) program, and one virtual AI summer camp. The AIA program was carried out in a local public school with four middle school students aged 12 to 13; the program consisted of eleven 2-hour sessions. The summer camp consisted of 2-hour sessions over 4 consecutive days, with 18 students aged 12 to 15. We facilitated both pilot programs with hands-on plugged and unplugged activities. The method of capturing data included artifact collection, structured interviews, written assessments, and a pre- to post-questionnaire tapping participants’ dispositions about AI and its societal implication. Participant artifacts, written assessments, survey, observation, and analysis of tasks completed revealed that the children improved in their knowledge of AI. In addition, the AI curriculum units and accompanying approaches developed for this study successfully engaged the participants, even without prior knowledge of related concepts. We also found an indication that introducing ethics of AI to adolescents will help their development as ethically responsive citizens. Our study results also indicate that lessons establishing links with students’ personal lives (e.g., letting students choose personally meaningful datasets) and societal implications using unplugged activities and interactive tools were particularly valuable for promoting AI and the integration of AI in middle school education across the subject domains and settings. Based on these results, we discuss our findings, identify their limitations, and propose future work.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have a deepening impact in our world. For empowered citizenship and career readiness, elementary and middle school students need to understand these technologies. To provide engaging introductory experiences, we created five original interactive software exhibits introducing children to hands-on activities in AI and ML. The exhibits were tested by 125 elementary and middle school students (aged 7 to 14). Four themes emerged: Students recognized that AI and ML systems can process data from cameras (perception); they saw that these systems responded to their training input (trust); they appreciated the practical import of AI/ML systems (affective and cognitive attitudes); and students were introduced to models and modes (specialization). This paper presents our goals in creating the exhibits and results from our initial testing with children. Our work contributes to the literature on formal and informal activities for introducing AI and ML to young learners.},

The curriculum is based on students learning computer science (CS) through creating apps that serve community and social good. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from students in three urban districts: 1) 330 paired pre- and post-survey responses indicating students' confidence and interest in both learning CS and creating apps for social good; 2) 343 open-ended question responses in the post-survey probing into students' perceptions on learning CS after taking the course. Whether there were gender differences emerged from both data were also examined. The results showed that students' confidence in coding and creating apps for social good significantly increased after completing the course, regardless of gender. However, their interest in pursuing CS learning remained at a low level. Further analysis showed male students reported significantly stronger interest than female students. Qualitative analysis of the open-ended responses revealed that both male and female students appreciated the collaborative learning environment and learning coding through making apps. Male students did not like certain instructional approaches that their teachers used. Female students expressed their dislike of coding in general. We applied an interest development theory to further understand these results, which suggested that we consider the trajectory of students' interest development of CS.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly in use in society. For young learners to be informed citizens and have full career potential it is important for them to understand these concepts. To support this learning, we created "ChemAIstry,'' an interactive software tool for children which demonstrates training and classification in machine learning. Students select which everyday items are safe to bring into a chemistry lab (e.g., a lab coat is safe; pizza is not). These selections serve as training input for a decision tree classifier. After training, students see how the trained model performs in classifying new objects. ChemAIstry was tested with 40 students aged 7 to 14 years at a public K?8 school. The software captured student selections during training. We analyzed these interactions to yield a "Correspondence Score,'' a measure of student understanding of the classification task. We screen-recorded student use of the software and audio-recorded our conversations with them during this use. Our analysis of these data indicates that students were able to understand the concept of model training, including that items were subsequently classified based on their training input. More than half of the student trials indicated that students correctly understood the task. This suggests ChemAIstry was effective in introducing students to these ideas in machine learning. We recommend continued development of related tools for curriculum integration of AI in K-8 education.},

abstract = {Data science and machine learning should not only be research areas for scientists and researchers but should also be accessible and understandable to the general audience. Enabling students to understand the details behind the technology will support them in becoming aware consumers and encourage them to become active participants. In this paper, we present instructional materials developed for introducing students to two key machine learning algorithms: decision trees and k-nearest neighbors. The materials were tested in a middle school's afterschool artificial intelligence program with four participating students aged 12 to 13. A combination of hands-on activities, innovative technology, and intuitive examples facilitated student learning. With hand-drawn decision trees and penguin species classifications, students used the algorithms to solve problems and anticipate other possible applications. We present the technology used, curriculum materials developed, and classroom structure. Following the guidelines from AI4K12 and introducing foundational machine learning algorithms, we hope to foster student interest in STEM fields.},

abstract = {To introduce middle school students to key concepts in image recognition, we created an interactive web application that performs sketch recognition and an afterschool curriculum for its use. Our app, called DoodleIt, was inspired by Google’s Quick, Draw!, and makes use of its accompanying open-source sketch library. With DoodleIt, students make simple line drawings on a canvas area and a previously-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) identifies the object drawn. The application dynamically visualizes the different layers that are involved in the process of CNNs, including a display of kernels, the resulting feature maps, and the percentage of match at output neurons. We used DoodleIt in an 18-hour curriculum to introduce middle school students to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Four hours of content were related to image recognition and the ethics of using AI. Here, we describe the design of the DoodleIt application, the approach we used to introduce the associated ideas to the students, and how we assessed student learning. Qualitative data collected from students are presented and discussed. Our findings indicate that students were able to understand the functionality of the kernels and feature maps involved in the CNN to perform rudimentary image recognition.},

Based on a collaboration among two public research universities and three urban school districts in the Northeast USA, the goal of the project is to establish an institutionalized middle school computer science curriculum in the districts. The CS curriculum incorporates digital literacy skills as an integral aspect of learning computer science, and is based on students developing mobile apps that provide social and community good. Here, we share our professional learning process during the project's first year, which had been developed iteratively and dynamically adjusted to a remote format in response to exigencies of Spring 2020. The paper includes analysis of three data sets from teacher-participants: (1) their questions about the nature of the project, which we categorized into three levels: project, district and teacher levels. These questions bridge the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners; (2) analysis of semi-structured interview conversations with more than half of the teacher-participants; and (3) teacher survey responses. Our findings include two recommendations: that RPP projects elicit teacher questions to illuminate the three levels identified, and use strategies that engage teachers in designing a professional learning process for teaching computer science.},

The assessment consisted of 24 multiple-choice items which tested student interpretation of assignment and equality operators. Answers were analyzed to determine each subject’s “Consistency Score,” which represents their consistency in this interpretation. The assessment was administered to computer science undergraduates at a public research university in the Northeast USA. The respondent results (n= 128) were compared to the students’ self-reported department GPA with the goal of determining whether consistency is correlated with student success. We found a positive correlation between a student’s Consistency Score and their department GPA, with strong significance. This suggests the use of this instrument as a diagnostic for supporting students. This paper presents the design of the assessment, how the Consistency Score is calculated, and the study results.},

  abstract={Research-practitioner partnership (RPP) projects using approaches such as design-based implementation research (DBIR), seek to build organizational infrastructure to develop, implement, and sustain educational innovation [19]. Infrastructure consists of the practices and objects that support educational practice. Infrastructure constitutes human and material resources and structures that support joint work [18,29]. Although RPP literature has identified co-design as an infrastructure-building approach, to the best of our knowledge, specific techniques for managing co-design and other infrastructure building practices are still lacking [9,18,23]. Without such tools, RPP partners' varied backgrounds, workplace norms, and priorities can produce behaviors that may be normal in the context of a single organization but can impede communication, resource access, and innovation implementation in a collaborative context. The NSF-funded Computer Science Pathways RPP (CS Pathways) project's DBIR approach uses co-design of a culturally responsive middle school CS curriculum to develop infrastructure for providing high-quality CS education across three urban school districts. The curriculum focuses on developing mobile apps for social good and will be taught by teachers with varied CS experience in varied classroom contexts (e.g., civics, science). The purpose of this workshop paper is to demonstrate a technique, namely Manager Tools One-on-one meetings [15], adapted by CS Pathways partners to manage the co-design process. O3s have six features: they are frequent; scheduled; 15 to 30 minutes in duration; held with all participants working on a specified project; semi-structured; and documented by the manager or researcher. This workshop paper describes how to use O3s to engage teachers and researchers in developing collaborative infrastructure to promote shared exploration of feedback and build and sustain partnerships.},

In this context, the phrase “disciplinary perspective” simultaneously holds two meanings: it refers to and aims to make connections between established K-12 STEM subject areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) and newer CT-integrated disciplines such as computational sciences. The special issue presents a framework for CT integration and includes articles that illuminate what CT looks like from a disciplinary perspective, the challenges inherent in integrating CT into K-12 STEM education, and new ways of measuring CT aligned more closely with disciplinary practices. The aim of this special issue is to offer research-based and practitioner-grounded insights into recent work in CT integration and provoke new ways of thinking about CT integration from researchers, practitioners, and research-practitioner partnerships.},

Inspired by CSTA’s national standards for K-12 computing education, the AI for K-12 guidelines will define what students in each grade band should know about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. The AI for K-12 working group is also creating an online resource directory where teachers can find AI- related videos, demos, software, and activity descriptions they can incorporate into their lesson plans. This blue sky talk invites the AI research community to reflect on the big ideas in AI that every K-12 student should know, and how we should communicate with the public about advances in AI and their future impact on society. It is a call to action for more AI researchers to become AI educators, creating resources that help teachers and students understand our work.},

The scenes, which vary in complexity, are viewable using virtual reality headsets, smartphones, and any device that supports a web browser. By providing access to the specific domain of virtual reality to students, the system aims to make computer science concepts tangible for novice programmers.

We developed an extension for App Inventor, called AppVis, which allows app-makers to publish and retrieve data from our existing web-based collaborative data visualization platform. We used AppVis with supporting instructional materials in two one-week summer camps attended by a total of 33 middle school students.

has used CUDA to accelerate various robot applications, but
particle filter-based SLAM has not been implemented on CUDA
yet. Because computations on the particles are independent of
each other in this algorithm, CUDA acceleration should be highly
effective. We have implemented the SLAM algorithm's most time
consuming step, particle weight calculation, and optimized
memory access by using texture memory to alleviate memory
bottleneck and fully leverage the parallel processing power. Our
experiments have shown the performance has increased by an
order of magnitude or more. The results indicate that oftloading

 abstract={In the field of probabilistic robotics, a central problem
                  is to determine a robot’s state given knowledge of a
                  time series of control commands and sensor
                  readings. The effects of control commands and the
                  behavior of sensor devices are both modeled
                  probabilistically. A variety of methods are
                  available for deriving the robot’s belief state,
                  which is a probabilistic representation of the
                  robot’s true state (which cannot be directly
                  known). This paper presents a series of five weekly
                  assignments to teach this material at the advanced
                  undergraduate/graduate level. The theoretical aspect
                  of the work is reinforced by practical
                  implementation exercises using ROS (Robot Operating
                  System), and the Bilibot, an educational robot
                  platform.},

abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) has been described as the use of abstraction, automation, and analysis in problem-solving [3]. We examine how these ways of thinking take shape for middle and high school youth in a set of NSF-supported programs. We discuss opportunities and challenges in both in-school and after-school contexts. Based on these observations, we present a "use-modify-create" framework, representing three phases of students' cognitive and practical activity in computational thinking. We recommend continued investment in the development of CT-rich learning environments, in educators who can facilitate their use, and in research on the broader value of computational thinking.},

  abstract={The Internet System for Networked Sensor Experimentation (iSENSE) enables users to store sensor data on the web, view data from other contributors, and combine data from multiple sources to examine regional, national, and global phenomena. Intended for educational use and citizen science applications, the system is compatible with a wide range of classroom probes and sensors. We have also prototyped a custom data-logging device—the Portable iSENSE Network Point, or PINPoint—which features on-board sensors, a GPS receiver, and a connector for external probes. By pooling their data on the web, users can create an expanded sensor network and engage in collaborative research on STEM topics ranging from human health to environmental science and energy conservation.},

  abstract = {This study examined how a professional development program which incorporates the use of electronic data-loggers could impact on science teachers’ attitudes towards inquiry-based teaching. The participants were 28 science or technology teachers who attended workshops offered in the United States and Japan. The professional development program emphasized (a) guided inquiry activities, (b) participants’ own exploration within the range of given tasks, (c) instructors’ guidance on the processes of inquiry and technology, and (d) discussions of the ways to bring their inquiry experiences in their classrooms.
Data sources included field notes, video recordings, artifacts, and survey responses. Analysis of participants’ discourse identified many instances in which the program helped the teachers deepen their understanding of inquiry-based teaching. The findings are presented as three assertions: (a) all the elements incorporated in the program contributed positively to participants’ engagement in inquiry, (b) connections between participants’ sensory experiences and graphical representations of data led them to have new understanding of the phenomena under the investigation, and (c) there were strong connections between their experiences about inquiry and teaching strategies that they wanted to incorporate in their classrooms. Applications of the findings into the development of more effective professional development programs will be discussed.},
