  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have a deepening impact in our world. For empowered citizenship and career readiness, elementary and middle school students need to understand these technologies. To provide engaging introductory experiences, we created five original interactive software exhibits introducing children to hands-on activities in AI and ML. The exhibits were tested by 125 elementary and middle school students (aged 7 to 14). Four themes emerged: Students recognized that AI and ML systems can process data from cameras (perception); they saw that these systems responded to their training input (trust); they appreciated the practical import of AI/ML systems (affective and cognitive attitudes); and students were introduced to models and modes (specialization). This paper presents our goals in creating the exhibits and results from our initial testing with children. Our work contributes to the literature on formal and informal activities for introducing AI and ML to young learners.},

abstract = {Fostering public AI literacy has been a growing area of interest at CHI for several years, and a substantial community is forming around issues such as teaching children how to build and program AI systems, designing learning experiences to broaden public understanding of AI, developing explainable AI systems, understanding how novices make sense of AI, and exploring the relationship between public policy, ethics, and AI literacy. Previous workshops related to AI literacy have been held at other conferences (e.g., SIGCSE, AAAI) that have been mostly focused on bringing together researchers and educators interested in AI education in K-12 classroom environments, an important subfield of this area. Our workshop seeks to cast a wider net that encompasses both HCI research related to introducing AI in K-12 education and also HCI research that is concerned with issues of AI literacy more broadly, including adult education, interactions with AI in the workplace, understanding how users make sense of and learn about AI systems, research on developing explainable AI (XAI) for non-expert users, and public policy issues related to AI literacy.},

abstract = {This study examined student learning outcomes from a culturally responsive middle school computer science (CS) curriculum. The curriculum is based on students creating mobile apps serving community and social good. Two sets of data were collected from 294 students in three urban districts: (1) pre- and post- survey responses on their attitudes toward learning CS and creating culturally responsive apps; (2) the apps created by those students. The analyses of student apps indicated that students were able to create basic apps that connected with their personal interests, life experiences, class community, and the larger society. Paired sample t-tests of pre- and post- survey results indicated that students were significantly more confident in coding and creating community-focused apps after completing the course, regardless of gender and race. However, their interest in solving coding problems and continuing to learn CS decreased afterward. Analyses of students' attitudes by gender, grade, and race showed significant differences among some of those groups. Seventh grade students rated more positively on their attitudes than eighth graders. Students of different racial groups indicated significantly different attitudes, especially the Southeast Asian and African American groups. Male students also reported stronger confidence and interest and more positive attitudes overall than female students.},

Enabling students to understand the details behind the technology will support them in becoming aware consumers and encourage them to become active participants. In this paper, we present instructional materials developed for introducing students to two key machine learning algorithms: decision trees and k-nearest neighbors. The materials were tested in a middle school's afterschool artificial intelligence program with four participating students aged 12 to 13. A combination of hands-on activities, innovative technology, and intuitive examples facilitated student learning. With hand-drawn decision trees and penguin species classifications, students used the algorithms to solve problems and anticipate other possible applications. We present the technology used, curriculum materials developed, and classroom structure. Following the guidelines from AI4K12 and introducing foundational machine learning algorithms, we hope to foster student interest in STEM fields.},

abstract = {To introduce middle school students to key concepts in image recognition, we created an interactive web application that performs sketch recognition and an afterschool curriculum for its use. Our app, called DoodleIt, was inspired by Google’s Quick, Draw!, and makes use of its accompanying open-source sketch library. With DoodleIt, students make simple line drawings on a canvas area and a previously-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) identifies the object drawn. The application dynamically visualizes the different layers that are involved in the process of CNNs, including a display of kernels, the resulting feature maps, and the percentage of match at output neurons. We used DoodleIt in an 18-hour curriculum to introduce middle school students to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Four hours of content were related to image recognition and the ethics of using AI. Here, we describe the design of the DoodleIt application, the approach we used to introduce the associated ideas to the students, and how we assessed student learning. Qualitative data collected from students are presented and discussed. Our findings indicate that students were able to understand the functionality of the kernels and feature maps involved in the CNN to perform rudimentary image recognition.},

 abstract={The ubiquity of AI in society means the time is ripe to consider what educated 21st century digital citizens should know about this subject. In May 2018, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) formed a joint working group to develop national guidelines for teaching AI to K-12 students. Inspired by CSTA’s national standards for K-12 computing education, the AI for K-12 guidelines will define what students in each grade band should know about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. The AI for K-12 working group is also creating an online resource directory where teachers can find AI- related videos, demos, software, and activity descriptions they can incorporate into their lesson plans. This blue sky talk invites the AI research community to reflect on the big ideas in AI that every K-12 student should know, and how we should communicate with the public about advances in AI and their future impact on society. It is a call to action for more AI researchers to become AI educators, creating resources that help teachers and students understand our work.},

Based on these observations, we present a "use-modify-create" framework, representing three phases of students' cognitive and practical activity in computational thinking.
