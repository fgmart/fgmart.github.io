  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have a deepening impact in our world. For empowered citizenship and career readiness, elementary and middle school students need to understand these technologies. To provide engaging introductory experiences, we created five original interactive software exhibits introducing children to hands-on activities in AI and ML. The exhibits were tested by 125 elementary and middle school students (aged 7 to 14). Four themes emerged: Students recognized that AI and ML systems can process data from cameras (perception); they saw that these systems responded to their training input (trust); they appreciated the practical import of AI/ML systems (affective and cognitive attitudes); and students were introduced to models and modes (specialization). This paper presents our goals in creating the exhibits and results from our initial testing with children. Our work contributes to the literature on formal and informal activities for introducing AI and ML to young learners.},

  abstract={This study investigated middle school students' learning experiences with a computer science and digital literacy (CSDL) curriculum, which was developed through the CS Pathways researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) project. The curriculum is based on students learning computer science (CS) through creating apps that serve community and social good. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected from students in three urban districts: 1) 330 paired pre- and post-survey responses indicating students' confidence and interest in both learning CS and creating apps for social good; 2) 343 open-ended question responses in the post-survey probing into students' perceptions on learning CS after taking the course. Whether there were gender differences emerged from both data were also examined. The results showed that students' confidence in coding and creating apps for social good significantly increased after completing the course, regardless of gender. However, their interest in pursuing CS learning remained at a low level. Further analysis showed male students reported significantly stronger interest than female students. Qualitative analysis of the open-ended responses revealed that both male and female students appreciated the collaborative learning environment and learning coding through making apps. Male students did not like certain instructional approaches that their teachers used. Female students expressed their dislike of coding in general. We applied an interest development theory to further understand these results, which suggested that we consider the trajectory of students' interest development of CS.},

  abstract={Machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly in use in society. For young learners to be informed citizens and have full career potential it is important for them to understand these concepts. To support this learning, we created "ChemAIstry,'' an interactive software tool for children which demonstrates training and classification in machine learning. Students select which everyday items are safe to bring into a chemistry lab (e.g., a lab coat is safe; pizza is not). These selections serve as training input for a decision tree classifier. After training, students see how the trained model performs in classifying new objects. ChemAIstry was tested with 40 students aged 7 to 14 years at a public K?8 school. The software captured student selections during training. We analyzed these interactions to yield a "Correspondence Score,'' a measure of student understanding of the classification task. We screen-recorded student use of the software and audio-recorded our conversations with them during this use. Our analysis of these data indicates that students were able to understand the concept of model training, including that items were subsequently classified based on their training input. More than half of the student trials indicated that students correctly understood the task. This suggests ChemAIstry was effective in introducing students to these ideas in machine learning. We recommend continued development of related tools for curriculum integration of AI in K-8 education.},

The curriculum is based on students creating mobile apps that serve community and social good. We collected two sets of data from 294 students in three urban districts: (1) pre- and post-survey responses on their learning experiences and attitudes toward learning CS and creating community-serving apps; (2) the apps created by those students. The analysis of student apps indicated that students were able to create basic apps that connected with their personal interests, life experiences, school community, and the larger society. Students were significantly more confident in coding and creating community-focused apps after completing the course, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, and grade. However, their interest in solving coding problems and continuing to learn CS decreased afterward. Analyses of students’ attitudes by gender, grade, and race/ethnicity showed significant differences among students in some groups. Seventh-grade students rated more positive on their attitudes than eighth graders. Students identifying with different race/ethnicity groups indicated significantly different attitudes, especially students identifying as Southeast Asian, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino. Self-identified male students also reported stronger interest and more positive attitudes overall than self-identified female students. Students also reported positive experiences in learning how to create real apps serving their community, while there were disparities in their experiences with coding in general and some of the instructional tools used in the class.},

Previous workshops related to AI literacy have been held at other conferences (e.g., SIGCSE, AAAI) that have been mostly focused on bringing together researchers and educators interested in AI education in K-12 classroom environments, an important subfield of this area. Our workshop seeks to cast a wider net that encompasses both HCI research related to introducing AI in K-12 education and also HCI research that is concerned with issues of AI literacy more broadly, including adult education, interactions with AI in the workplace, understanding how users make sense of and learn about AI systems, research on developing explainable AI (XAI) for non-expert users, and public policy issues related to AI literacy.},

The materials were tested in a middle school's afterschool artificial intelligence program with four participating students aged 12 to 13. A combination of hands-on activities, innovative technology, and intuitive examples facilitated student learning. With hand-drawn decision trees and penguin species classifications, students used the algorithms to solve problems and anticipate other possible applications.

Our app, called DoodleIt, was inspired by Google’s Quick, Draw!, and makes use of its accompanying open-source sketch library. With DoodleIt, students make simple line drawings on a canvas area and a previously-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) identifies the object drawn. The application dynamically visualizes the different layers that are involved in the process of CNNs, including a display of kernels, the resulting feature maps, and the percentage of match at output neurons. We used DoodleIt in an 18-hour curriculum to introduce middle school students to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Four hours of content were related to image recognition and the ethics of using AI. Here, we describe the design of the DoodleIt application, the approach we used to introduce the associated ideas to the students, and how we assessed student learning. Qualitative data collected from students are presented and discussed. Our findings indicate that students were able to understand the functionality of the kernels and feature maps involved in the CNN to perform rudimentary image recognition.},

Inspired by CSTA’s national standards for K-12 computing education, the AI for K-12 guidelines will define what students in each grade band should know about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics. The AI for K-12 working group is also creating an online resource directory where teachers can find AI- related videos, demos, software, and activity descriptions they can incorporate into their lesson plans. This blue sky talk invites the AI research community to reflect on the big ideas in AI that every K-12 student should know, and how we should communicate with the public about advances in AI and their future impact on society. It is a call to action for more AI researchers to become AI educators, creating resources that help teachers and students understand our work.},

  abstract={The Internet System for Networked Sensor Experimentation (iSENSE) enables users to store sensor data on the web, view data from other contributors, and combine data from multiple sources to examine regional, national, and global phenomena. Intended for educational use and citizen science applications, the system is compatible with a wide range of classroom probes and sensors. We have also prototyped a custom data-logging device—the Portable iSENSE Network Point, or PINPoint—which features on-board sensors, a GPS receiver, and a connector for external probes. By pooling their data on the web, users can create an expanded sensor network and engage in collaborative research on STEM topics ranging from human health to environmental science and energy conservation.},

  abstract = {This study examined how a professional development program which incorporates the use of electronic data-loggers could impact on science teachers’ attitudes towards inquiry-based teaching. The participants were 28 science or technology teachers who attended workshops offered in the United States and Japan. The professional development program emphasized (a) guided inquiry activities, (b) participants’ own exploration within the range of given tasks, (c) instructors’ guidance on the processes of inquiry and technology, and (d) discussions of the ways to bring their inquiry experiences in their classrooms.
Data sources included field notes, video recordings, artifacts, and survey responses. Analysis of participants’ discourse identified many instances in which the program helped the teachers deepen their understanding of inquiry-based teaching. The findings are presented as three assertions: (a) all the elements incorporated in the program contributed positively to participants’ engagement in inquiry, (b) connections between participants’ sensory experiences and graphical representations of data led them to have new understanding of the phenomena under the investigation, and (c) there were strong connections between their experiences about inquiry and teaching strategies that they wanted to incorporate in their classrooms. Applications of the findings into the development of more effective professional development programs will be discussed.},
