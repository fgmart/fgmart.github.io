Hi, everyone! I am a professor of computer science
at the Univerity of Texas at San Antonio. I'm also chair of the
department. I started August 1, 2023.



<b>Chair's Welcome.</b> It is my privilege to serve the Computer
Science department as chair. I strive that all have the opportunity to
pursue their professional success and to foster an enviroment where
all are respected and valued members of our community.

Future and prospective students (and parents and other family
members): please see my highlights regarding our <a
href="undergraduate">undergraduate</a> and <a
href="graduate">graduate</a> programs.


<b>My Research.</b> I create novel technologies to empower young learners
as designers with computing, artificial intelligence, and data
science. My students and I have designed robotics construction kits, a
collaborative data visualization platform, and a <a
href="learnmyr.org">virtual reality programming environment</a>.

I work with K&#150;12 teachers and school districts to bring these
materials to their students.

I collaborate with faculty in computer science, education, and
psychology to create new technologies and curricula, and to study how
people learn when using them.

My team is called the Engaging Computing Group&#151;see <a
href="people">people</a>, <a href="projects">projects</a>, and our <a
href="publications">publications</a>.



<b>My Teaching.</b> I've yet to teach an &#147;organized course&#148; at
UTSA! (That's what we call regularly-scheduled courses.) My
<a href="teaching">teaching</a> page is stubbed in for future
development.



<b>Before UTSA</b>, I was at <a href="https://www.uml.edu">UMass
Lowell</a>. I started in 2002 as an asst. prof. of computer
science. After tenure, I did a lot of administrative service,
including being an associate dean. Here's my <a
