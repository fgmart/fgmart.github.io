Hi, everyone! I joined UT San Antonio on August 1, 2023 as
professor and chair of computer science. Beginning June 1, 2025, I
am Interim Dean of our new [College of AI, Cyber and
Computing](https://caicc.utsa.edu).


**Dean's Welcome.** It is my privilege to serve the UT San Antonio
community as your interim dean.  I strive to support all of
us&#151;students, staff, and faculty&#151;in pursuing our professional
successes. I wish to foster an environment where all are respected and
valued members of our community.

Please see [information about the degree
programs](https://caicc.utsa.edu/programs/) stewarded by our new
college and some of your [questions answered
here](https://www.utsa.edu/strategicplan/initiatives/academic/ai-cyber-computing-data-science/faq/). Please
[email me](mailto:fred.martin@utsa.edu?subject=CAICC questions and
ideas) to share any questions, ideas, and suggestions!

Future and prospective CS majors (and parents and other family
members): please see my FAQs about our computer science
[undergraduate](undergrad) and [graduate](grad) programs.

**My Research.** I create novel technologies to empower young
learners in discovering computing, artificial intelligence, and
data science. My students and I have designed robotics construction
kits, a collaborative data visualization platform, and a virtual
reality programming environment.

I work with K&#150;12 teachers and school districts to bring these
materials to their students. I collaborate with faculty in computer
science, education, and psychology to create new technologies and
curricula, and to study how people learn when using them.

My team is called the Engaging Computing Group&#151;see our
[people](people), [projects](projects), and [publications](publications).


**My Teaching.** Since Spring 2024, I have been teaching [CS 4953/5463
  Developing AI Tools for K-12](teaching/). Beginning
  in Fall 2024 I am co-teaching it with Drs. Ismaila Sanusi and Deepti
  Tagare. Students in our graduate programs, including the [MS in
  AI](https://future.utsa.edu/programs/master/artificial-intelligence/),
  may take the graduate section as an elective.


**Before UT San Antonio**, I was at the [University of Massachusetts
Lowell](https://www.uml.edu). I started in 2002 as an asst. prof. of
computer science. After tenure, I did a lot of administrative service,
including being an associate dean. Here's my [web page
there](https://www.cs.uml.edu/~fredm).
