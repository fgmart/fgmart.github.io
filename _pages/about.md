Hi, everyone! I am a professor of computer science
at the Univerity of Texas at San Antonio. I'm also chair of the
department. I started at UTSA on August 1, 2023.



**Chair's Welcome.** It is my privilege to serve the Computer
Science department as chair. I strive that all have the opportunity to
pursue their professional success and to foster an environment where
all are respected and valued members of our community.

Future and prospective students (and parents and other family
members): please see my FAQs about our [undergraduate](undergrad) and
[graduate](grad) programs.


**My Research.** I create novel technologies to empower young
learners as designers with computing, artificial intelligence, and
data science. My students and I have designed robotics construction
kits, a collaborative data visualization platform, and a [virtual
reality programming environment](https://learnmyr.org).

I work with K&#150;12 teachers and school districts to bring these
materials to their students. I collaborate with faculty in computer
science, education, and psychology to create new technologies and
curricula, and to study how people learn when using them.

My team is called the Engaging Computing Group&#151;see our
[people](people), [projects](projects), and [publications](publications).



**My Teaching.** In Spring 2024, I am teaching a research-oriented
  independent study topics class, [CS 4913 Developing AI Tools for
  Children](teaching/DevelopingAITools). 




**Before UTSA**, I was at the [University of Massachusetts
Lowell](https://www.uml.edu). I started in 2002 as an asst. prof. of
computer science. After tenure, I did a lot of administrative service,
including being an associate dean. Here's my [web page
there](https://www.cs.uml.edu/~fredm).
