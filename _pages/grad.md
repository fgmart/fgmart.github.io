**What graduate programs are offered?**

We have three Master of Science (MS) programs and one Doctor of Philosphy (PhD) program:

* *MS in Computer Science* [[catalog]](https://catalog.utsa.edu/graduate/sciences/computerscience/#degreestext) [[apply]](https://future.utsa.edu/programs/master/computer-science/) \\
This is our comprehensive MS program which provides a powerful
foundation in the computer science discipline and allows you to
specialize with advanced courses.

* *MS in Cybersecurity Science* [[catalog]](https://catalog.utsa.edu/graduate/sciences/computerscience/#degreestext) [[apply]](https://future.utsa.edu/programs/master/cybersecurity-science/) \\
This is a degree based in the computer science discipline with a
specific focus on cybersecurity.

* *MS in Artificial Intelligence* [[catalog]](https://catalog.utsa.edu/graduate/translationalscience/#degreestext) [[apply]](https://future.utsa.edu/programs/master/artificial-intelligence/) \\
Our program in Artificial Intelligence is offered jointly by UTSA's
Departments of Computer Science; Electrical and Computer Engineering
(ECE); and Statistics. It's formally administered by our campus's
University College. You have the opportunity to take courses in all
three departments.

* *PhD in Computer Science* [[catalog]](https://catalog.utsa.edu/graduate/sciences/computerscience/#degreestext) [[apply]](https://future.utsa.edu/programs/doctoral/computer-science/) \\
This is the research-based degree in computer science in which you
conduct foundational and advanced coursework and carry out an original
research dissertation supervised by our faculty members.


**What is the difference between an MS degree and the PhD degree?**

Broadly, an MS program prepares you for careers in industry while the
PhD program prepares you for a research career, including faculty
careers.

**What prior experience is required to be successful?**

Generally, you should have technical background in a science or
engineering field (i.e., an undergraduate degree). It's OK if you don't have
computer science background specifically; prior programming
experience is helpful in this case.

For our MS programs, we may stipulate up to two required &#147;bridge
courses&#148; to give you necessary background in the computing
field. Please note that these courses do not count towards the MS
degree itself.

Please see specific application requirements at our &#147;apply&#148; links above.

**What financial support is available for MS students?**

Please see the [Computer Science Department Scholarships
page](https://sciences.utsa.edu/computer-science/scholarships/) and
scroll down to the section &#147;Additional Support for Graduate
Students.&#148; 

**What financial support is available for PhD students?**

All full-time, admitted PhD students are welcomed with an appointment
as either a Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) or Graduate Research
Assistant (GRA). This is comprehensive support that comes with a
tuition waiver, stipend, and health insurance. The stipend is a
year-round award starting at $2,000 per month.

Please see more information at the &#147;Funding Opportunities&#148;
tab at the PhD &#147;apply&#148; link above.

**What kind of research can I do?**

Please see the [CS Department's research
areas web page](https://sciences.utsa.edu/computer-science/research/), which
includes a list of faculty members in each area. 

During your first year as a doctoral student, you will engage in a
structured process for you to find your PhD advisor.

Based on your existing interests, you are welcome to reach out to
faculty during your application process and after acceptance to the
program.

Master's students have the option of participating in research. The MS
degree programs offer Project (one-semester) and Thesis (two-semester)
research options.

**Where is the official catalog information about the graduate programs in Computer Science?**

Please see the &#147;catalog&#148; links next to each of the programs
listed above.

**For applying to the PhD program, can I be exempted from TOEFL/IELTS examination requirement?**

The Graduate School's [International Graduate Student
Admission](https://catalog.utsa.edu/policies/admission/graduate/internationalgraduatestudents/)
page lists countries from which students are exempted from the English
language exam requirement.

If your home country appears on this list, you do not have to submit these exam scores.

**How do I apply?**

Please see the &#147;apply&#148; links next to each of the programs
listed above.

**Where is the main UTSA Computer Science Department web site?**

It's here: [https://sciences.utsa.edu/computer-science/](https://sciences.utsa.edu/computer-science/).
