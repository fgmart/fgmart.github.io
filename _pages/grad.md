**What graduate programs are offered?**

We have three Master of Science (MS) programs and one Doctor of Philosphy (PhD) program:

* *MS in Computer Science* [ [catalog] ](catalog-link) [ [apply] ](future-rr-link) \\
This is our comprehensive MS program which provides a powerful
foundation in the computer science discipline and allows you to
specialize with advanced courses.

* *MS in Cybersecurity Science* [ [catalog] ](catalog-link) [ [apply] ](future-rr-link) \\
This is a degree based in the computer science discipline with a
specific focus on cybersecurity.

* *MS in Artificial Intelligence* [ [catalog] ](catalog-link) [ [apply] ](future-rr-link) \\
Our program in Artificial Intelligence is offered jointly by UTSA's
Departments of Computer Science; Electrical and Computer Engineering
(ECE); and Statistics. It's formally administered by our campus's
University College. You have the opportunity to take courses in all
three departments.

* *PhD in Computer Science* [ [catalog] ](catalog-link) [ [apply] ](future-rr-link) \\
This is the research-based degree in computer science in which you
conduct foundational and advanced coursework and carry out an original
research dissertation supervised by our faculty members.


**What is the difference between an MS degree and the PhD degree?**

Broadly, an MS program prepares you for careers in industry while the
PhD program prepares you for a research career, including faculty
careers.

**What prior experience is required to be successful?**

Generally, you should have technical background in a science or
engineering field (an undergraduate degree). It's OK if you don't have
a computer science background specifically; prior programming
experience is helpful in this case.

For our MS programs, we may stipulate up to two required &#147;bridge
courses&#148; to give you necessary background in the computing
field. Please note that these courses do not count towards the MS
degree itself.

There are specific requirements for international students. Please see
information at our &#147;apply&#148; links above.
