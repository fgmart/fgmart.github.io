---

**What Is This?**
&#147;Developing AI Tools for Children&#148; is a directed study course.

We will review the literature on existing work, conceive of and build prototypes of new tools, and then test them with our target audience (middle school-age children).

Please be prepared to do literature reviews, read papers, write code, learn how to do education research, and write a paper.

**The Semester's Arc**
The semester will involve the following activities and schedule:

Jan through mid-Feb | Literature review; how to conduct education research (including human-subjects research training); initial brainstorming of project ideas
second half of Feb | Project implementation begins; evaluation design
first half of Mar | Project implementation continues; preparation and submission of research proposals to UML&#146;s Institutional Review Board (IRB)
second half of Mar | Project implementation concludes
first half of Apr | Testing with children
second half of Apr | Writing final paper

&nbsp;

**Teams** For the project work (including implementation, research
design, data collection, analysis, and writeup), I encourage students
to work collaboratively in teams of two or three.



### Assignments

**Week 1**

1. Request to join our [Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/g/developing-ai-tools-spr24). You
need this for access to the two papers below.
 * Join our Discord group using the info in the Google Group.

1. Create a web site where you will keep track of your work and make
it available to this class for sharing. You can either make it public
or make it private but in a way that all of us in this class have
access. ***Send me the link to your web site by 8 AM Sat Jan 19.*** I
will add your site link to this site so we all have access to each
other's work. See [last year's class at UMass
Lowell](https://www.cs.uml.edu/ecg/index.php/DevelopingAITools/StudentPages)
for an example.  

1. Read these two papers, available at our [Google Drive
folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mO3MYmMt-b0SZc763X4If9lzzgykz1Pp). Post
short reflections (250 words ea) on the papers on your web site. Don't
summarize. Instead, *focus on what you found surprising or interesting
about the papers.* ***Post these to your web site by 8 AM Mon Jan 22.***
 * Lee, I., Ali, S., Zhang, H., DiPaola, D., & Breazeal, C. (2021, March). Developing Middle School Students' AI Literacy. In *Proceedings of the 52nd ACM technical symposium on computer science education* (pp. 191-197).

1. If you have not already, create an account at
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), the AI chat agent. Use it to get
some ideas for ways to engage children in learning about AI. On your
web site, share (1) your best ChatGPT prompt and (2) your favorite
response from it, ***due 8 AM on Mon Jan 22.***

1. Prior to the next meeting, review the work of at least three of
your classmates. Please take private notes for discussion at the next
class meeting.
