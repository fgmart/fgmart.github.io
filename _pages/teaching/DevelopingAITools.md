**What Is This?**
We will review the literature on existing work, conceive of and build prototypes of new tools, and then test them with our target audience (middle school-age children).

Please be prepared to do literature reviews, read papers, write code, learn how to do education research, and write a paper.

**When and Where?**
We meet in San Pedro I (Downtown) rm 325 on Tuesdays from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM.

**The Semester's Arc**
The semester will involve the following activities and schedule:

Jan through mid-Feb | Literature review; how to conduct education research (including human-subjects research training); initial brainstorming of project ideas
second half of Feb | Project implementation begins; evaluation design
first half of Mar | Project implementation continues; preparation and submission of research proposals to UTSA&#146;s Institutional Review Board (IRB)
second half of Mar | Project implementation concludes
first half of Apr | Testing with children
second half of Apr | Writing final paper

&nbsp;

**Teams** For the project work (including implementation, research
design, data collection, analysis, and writeup), I encourage students
to work collaboratively in teams of two or three.
