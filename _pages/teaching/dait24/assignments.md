Martin. 2023. *DoodleIt: A Novel Tool and Approach for Teaching How CNNs Perform Image Recognition*.

### Assignments

1. Find another paper in the space of **AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science** tools for K-12 learners. Claim it by posting a citation in the new ```#papers``` channel in our Discord. Upload it to the Google Drive folder. On your Week 2 web site area, write a 250-summary of the paper. Link directly to your paper from your web site. Make sure your paper hasn't been claimed already when you choose it! (everyone must have a unique paper)

2. Think of **three** concepts in AI/ML/DS you might be interested in developing a project around. Write ~250 words describing each of these three AI concepts and situating each of them in the “Five Big Ideas” themes developed by Touretsky et al. in the paper above. It's fine if any given of your three concepts fits in multiple themes. (Note: the AI4K12 Big Ideas doesn't really have an area for data science. That's fine—don't worry about this if you're interested in a data science idea.)

3. For the Williams et al. paper on Pop-Bots, write a ~250-word reflection on how they handled assessing student learning outcomes.

4. For the Mahipal et al. and Trivedi et al. papers, write a ~250-word reflection (each) on what is most interesting / surprising about this article. This should not be a summary.

5. If you haven't already completed UTSA's IRB Human Subject Training, start it now. Create an account per files shared in Discord. Do the first four modules in the Social and Behavioral Research training.

Reflections are due on your web sites by **9 AM on Mon Jan 29**.

**Week 1**

1. Request to join our [Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/g/developing-ai-tools-spr24). You
need this for access to the two papers below.
 * Join our Discord group using the info in the Google Group.

1. Create a web site where you will keep track of your work and make
it available to this class for sharing. You can either make it public
or make it private but in a way that all of us in this class have
access. ***Send me the link to your web site by 8 AM Sat Jan 19.*** I
will add your site link to this site so we all have access to each
other's work. See [last year's class at UMass
Lowell](https://www.cs.uml.edu/ecg/index.php/DevelopingAITools/StudentPages)
for an example.  

1. Read these two papers, available at our [Google Drive
folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mO3MYmMt-b0SZc763X4If9lzzgykz1Pp). Post
short reflections (250 words ea) on the papers on your web site. Don't
summarize. Instead, *focus on what you found surprising or interesting
about the papers.* ***Post these to your web site by 8 AM Mon Jan 22.***
 * Lee, I., Ali, S., Zhang, H., DiPaola, D., & Breazeal, C. (2021, March). Developing Middle School Students' AI Literacy. In *Proceedings of the 52nd ACM technical symposium on computer science education* (pp. 191-197).
 * Long, D., & Magerko, B. (2020, April). What is AI literacy? Competencies and design considerations. In *Proceedings of the 2020 CHI conference on human factors in computing systems* (pp. 1-16).

1. If you have not already, create an account at
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), the AI chat agent. Use it to get
some ideas for ways to engage children in learning about AI. On your
web site, share (1) your best ChatGPT prompt and (2) your favorite
response from it, ***due 8 AM on Mon Jan 22.***

1. Prior to the next meeting, review the work of at least three of
your classmates. Please take private notes for discussion at the next
class meeting.
