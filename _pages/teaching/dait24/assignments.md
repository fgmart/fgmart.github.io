**Week 1**

1. Request to join our [Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/g/developing-ai-tools-spr24). You
need this for access to the two papers below.
 * Join our Discord group using the info in the Google Group.

1. Create a web site where you will keep track of your work and make
it available to this class for sharing. You can either make it public
or make it private but in a way that all of us in this class have
access. ***Send me the link to your web site by 8 AM Sat Jan 19.*** I
will add your site link to this site so we all have access to each
other's work. See [last year's class at UMass
Lowell](https://www.cs.uml.edu/ecg/index.php/DevelopingAITools/StudentPages)
for an example.  

1. Read these two papers, available at our [Google Drive
folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mO3MYmMt-b0SZc763X4If9lzzgykz1Pp). Post
short reflections (250 words ea) on the papers on your web site. Don't
summarize. Instead, *focus on what you found surprising or interesting
about the papers.* ***Post these to your web site by 8 AM Mon Jan 22.***

1. If you have not already, create an account at
[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), the AI chat agent. Use it to get
some ideas for ways to engage children in learning about AI. On your
web site, share (1) your best ChatGPT prompt and (2) your favorite
response from it, ***due 8 AM on Mon Jan 22.***

1. Prior to the next meeting, review the work of at least three of
your classmates. Please take private notes for discussion at the next
class meeting.
