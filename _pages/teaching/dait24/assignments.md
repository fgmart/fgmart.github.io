&nbsp;


**Week 7**

### Readings
No assigned readings this week.

### Assignments

1. Create a PDF document for inclusion in our submission to the UTSA
IRB as part of our approval to conduct research with students.

    The PDF should include:
    * a screenshot of your app main interface.
    * a brief description of how your app works / what students will do when they use it (50 words max)
    * a discussion of the data that your app will automatically gather during use.
    * survey items you will have students complete after use (may be delivered verbally or in written form)

    The PDF should be two pages maximum. Name it ```your-project-name-author1lastname-author2lastname.pdf```.

    Link the PDF to your website *and also* upload it to the [assessments folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oAQUkmus4cgdDci6keGhlh67wlcoPEo4) on Google Drive.

2. Continue work on your implementation, *including starting work on
the automated data gathering*. Please be prepared to present in class
on Tue Apr 5.

&nbsp;


**Week 6**

### Readings
No assigned readings this week.

### Assignments

1. 
I request that your web site has a dedicated area for the
project. If you've presently documented the project as part of a
continuous stream of assignment updates, please break it out to its
own dedicated area. (TY)

    Some people do not have a project area on their web site---because
    their partner has it. That is fine. However, make sure there is a
    project menu item that links to the project area on your partner's
    page.


1. Create a detailed plan of what usage metrics your app will gather
from users.

    Durga and Adrian have an [exemplary
plan](https://sites.google.com/view/durga-develop-ai-tool-for-kids/project/usage-data-we-plan-to-collect). Please
review this and use it as a model. Please also re-read Saniya's *Ask
Me Anything* paper for inspiration; the fine-grained data we gathered in this project were essential to our argument of research findings.

    It is not sufficient to only plan for screen-recording; your plan
    must be customized to your specific app. You will want semantic
    click data that you can interpret for meaning.

    Your app should also collect student first name, grade level, and at least one usage timestamp.

    Please have a detailed plan published on your web site for the next meeting.

1. Write post-assessment for how you will learn about students' understandings after using your tool.

    This can be in the form of a survey with multiple-choice,
    fill-in-the-blank, and/or complete-the-sentence prompts.

    Make sure to ask for the student's first name, grade level, and
    date/time of survey being filled out. This will allow you to
    connect the survey to the electronic usage log even if you have
    multiple students with the same first name and grade level.

    Please see this [student work from Spr '23](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14UA-3ui7pvl-Fxr3RFIaAj_FHWLwJCwr) for examples.
    
1. Continue work on your project implementation.


&nbsp;

**Week 5**

### Readings
No assigned readings this week.

### Assignments
1. Start building out your project. Plan to show some kind of live demo at our next meeting.
1. Prepare a plan for what kind of usage data your app will collect (and how it will record those data). Have this written up on your app's area of your web site.

&nbsp;


**Week 4**

### Readings

1. Shuchi Grover's preprint [Teaching AI in K-12 Learners: Lessons,
Issues, and
Guidance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Bt-p6CvaFYF4zFaAUW2cu3SvvMQRxoW/view),
a best paper [SIGCSE '24](https://sigcse2024.sigcse.org/profile/shuchigrover).

1. Saniya and Fred's [Exploring children's attitudes toward an
age-tailored AI-powered
chatbot](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BcGdgQlwBAFb-QmRESEfi90SWZzTK4BY/view). This is a draft under review; do not quote in your own writings. But see reflection prompt below.

### Assignments

1. For the Grover paper, write a ~250-word reflection on what is most interesting / surprising about this article. This should not be a summary.

1. For the Exploring children's attitudes paper, write a ~250-word reflection on how they handled assessing student learning outcomes.

1. Finish Social/Behavioral Research Course:
   * Privacy and Confidentiality
   * Conflicts of Interest in Human Subjects Research
   * two UTSA modules
   
   and upload certificate to our [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10M85xZcVKdkjawGzbtFc6mniO9BG6hQ2).\
   Modify filename to include your full name and completion date, per examples there.

1. Make project initial prototype of GUI and development plan so that
you can show some initial version on on Tue Mar 5 (during MATRIX-AI
Spring School '24.) Post on one partner's web site.

&nbsp;


**Week 3**

### Readings & Viewing

1. Watch [Gender Shades](https://youtu.be/TWWsW1w-BVo) by Joy
Boulamwini, which addresses bias in face recognition technology.

1. Select and read two of the papers chosen by your peers last
week. See more in Assignments.

### Assignments

1. The state of the art in face recognition has improved since
Dr. Boulamwini's research, owing in substantial part to the impact of
her work, but the issue of bias in AI technology is still pervasive
and embedded. Do a little web-searching on this and describe a few
other areas of AI where bias still an issue (~250 words). Post in your
Week 3 area of your web site.

1. Per above in Readings, choose two of the papers identified by your
peers that you'll read. Then, combining with the paper you selected,
write a ~500 to 750 word synthesis that compares the three
papers. Please focus on papers that involve children in a study. I'm
looking for similarities and differences in the research
methodologies. Post on your Week 3 page.

1. Form a team with one or two other students and develop an idea for
your semester project.

   On one team member's web site, create an area where all team members can make edits. Other member(s) of the team should link to the central site from their own sites.

   Write an initial draft of the idea, including:

      * overview of the premise;
      * which ideas in AI will be taught;
      * one or more drawings presenting the how it will look and work (e.g., it could be a storyboard with several frames indicating how users interact)
      * a description of how children will interact with the system;
      * a discussion of what data you could gather.

   In addition to surveys and interview data, make sure to consider
   about data that can be gathered electronically as a direct result
   of children's interaction with your system.

   Consider how you will engage students in considering the ethics of
   AI as part of your project.

   This idea is a first draft; please consider it as open to change as
   you move forward.

1. Complete the next three modules in the CITI course:

   * The Federal Regulations
   * Assessing Risk
   * Informed Consent

&nbsp;

### Assignments

1. Find another paper in the space of **AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science** tools for K-12 learners. Claim it by posting a citation in the new ```#papers``` channel in our Discord. Upload it to the Google Drive folder. On your Week 2 web site area, write a 250-summary of the paper. Link directly to your paper from your web site. Make sure your paper hasn't been claimed already when you choose it! (everyone must have a unique paper)

2. Think of **three** concepts in AI/ML/DS you might be interested in developing a project around. Write ~250 words describing each of these three AI concepts and situating each of them in the “Five Big Ideas” themes developed by Touretsky et al. in the paper above. It's fine if any given of your three concepts fits in multiple themes. If it makes sense to include a sketch to describe your idea, please do that. (Note: the AI4K12 Big Ideas doesn't really have an area for data science. That's fine—don't worry about this if you're interested in a data science idea.)

3. For the Williams *et al.* paper on Pop-Bots, write a ~250-word reflection on how they handled assessing student learning outcomes.

4. For the Mahipal *et al.* paper, write a ~250-word reflection on what is most interesting / surprising about this article. This should not be a summary.

5. If you haven't already completed UTSA's IRB Human Subject Training, start it now. Create an account per files shared in Discord. Do the first three modules in the Social and Behavioral Research training:
* Belmont Report and Its Principles
* History and Ethical Principles
