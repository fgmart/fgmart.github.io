**Meeting 11: Tue Apr 2, 2024**

1. Finalized plans for data collection with students:
* Your software should ask for FIRST-NAME, LAST-NAME, and GRADE (6, 7, or 8)
* Grade should be a drop down menu. Don't make them type it in.
* Install Zoom or other screen- and audio-recording software on your laptop. Make sure you have a valid account to use (e.g. your UTSA credentials, which should give you 40-min meetings on Zoom before you have to restart).
* I recommend using Google Forms to create your surveys and then print out blank copies for students to fill in after they use your software.
