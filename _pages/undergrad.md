Please contact [Dr. Fred Martin](mailto:fred.martin@utsa.edu) if you
have any questions.

**What bachelors degrees does the Computer Science department offer?** \
The Computer Science department offers two Bachelor of Science degree programs:

* B.S. in Computer Science
* B.S. in Software Engineering

Please see the [catalog page](https://catalog.utsa.edu/undergraduate/sciences/computerscience/#degreestext) and scroll to the details on each program.

**Is prior coding experience required?** \
Prior coding experience is *not* required to be successful in Computer
Science at UTSA! We are happy to welcome students with all prior
backgrounds. Our first-semester computer science class is [CS 1083
Programming I](https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%201083). It will
teach you everything you need to know to get started as a computer
scientist.

**What concentrations and tracks are offered?**\
Concentrations:
* Cloud and Systems
* Cybersecurity
* Data Science
* Software Engineering

Track:
* Cyber Operations

See details at the [catalog
page](https://catalog.utsa.edu/undergraduate/sciences/computerscience/#degreestext).


**What math background is required for admission?** \
If you are applying for Fall admission, no special requirements are in
place. If you are applying for Spring or Summer admission, you must be
[pre-calculus ready](https://future.utsa.edu/rowdy-ready/#aleks). If
you are a transfer student, you need to have completed the equivalent
of MAT 1073 Algebra or higher with grade of C- or better.

See more at the [CS Future Roadrunner
page](https://future.utsa.edu/programs/undergraduate/computer-science/).

**Can the BS degree be completed fully online?** \
The Computer Science degree programs are in-person programs.

Many courses are available via Zoom and a few are available
asynchronously.

However, one must attend classes in-person in order to complete the
degree programs.

**What programming languages will I learn?** \
You will necessarily learn the Java language and the C language.

Our first three semesters are all taught in Java (CS 1083 Programming
I, CS 2113 Fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming, and CS 2123
Data Structures).

Typically taken in the third semester, you will take CS 2173
Programming in C.

**What kind of computer should I bring?** \
Consistent with our campus-wide [Hardware
Specifications](https://www.utsa.edu/techsolutions/students/hardware/)
guidance, the university---and the Computer Science
Department---provide ample computing resources on campus. Bringing
your own computer is optional.

Of course, if you do have your own computer, you can use it on campus.

Any of the major operating systems will be fine for your work in Computer Science---Windows, Mac, or Linux.

If there is one recommendation, it would be to have a machine that supports the use of virtual machines. This would suggest at least 16 GB of RAM.

**How will I be supported with academic advising?** \
You will be assigned an academic advisor who has deep knowledge of the
CS degree programs.

See more at the [Advising Center Home](https://www.utsa.edu/advising/)
page.

**How can I get academic credit for an internship?** \
You can earn up to 3 credits when supervised by a CS faculty member
during a internship job.

The internship must be related to computer science and you must
arrange for the academic credit *prior to beginning the job*.

Contact the [CS Department](mailto:cs@utsa.edu?subject=internship info request)
for information.

**What are my career opportunities after graduating?** \
CS majors typically get jobs as sofware developers in national tech firms,
regional companies, startups, and a wide range of companies including
financial services, healthcare, education, government agencies, and
consulting firms.

**How can I get involved in undergraduate research?** \
Doing research as an undergraduate is a great way to both prepare for
your first internship and to explore if graduate school is right for
you.

Please see resources available to CS majors [here](https://sites.google.com/view/utsa-cs-research).

**What student clubs are part of Computer Science?** \
The CS department hosts [ACM UTSA](https://acmutsa.org/), which is a
student chapter of the international Association for Computing
Machinery, the professional association for computer scientists.

ACM UTSA includes six sub-organizations:
[ACM-W](https://acmutsa.org/suborg_acmw/), [ICPC (International
Collegiate Programming
Competition)](https://acmutsa.org/suborg_icpc/), [Rowdy
Creators](https://acmutsa.org/suborg_rowdy_creators/), [Coding in
Color](https://acmutsa.org/suborg_cic/),
[RowdyHacks](https://acmutsa.org/suborg_rowdyhacks/), and [Code
Quantum](https://cqhacks.org/)).
