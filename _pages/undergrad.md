**THIS PAGE UNDER DEVELOPMENT!!**

**Please contact [Dr. Fred Martin](mailto:fred.martin@utsa.edu) if you have any questions.**

UTSA offers a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. The
official catalog information about the program is <a
href="https://www.utsa.edu/catalog/undergraduate/computer-science">here</a>. 

**Is prior coding experience required?** \
Prior coding experience is *not* required to be successful in Computer Science at UTSA! We are happy to welcome students with all prior backgrounds. Our first-semester computer science class is [CS 1083 Programming I](https://catalog.utsa.edu/search/?P=CS%201083). It will teach you everything you need to know to get started as a computer scientist.

**What are the math requirements?**

**Can the BS degree be completed fully online?**

**What changes launched in beginning in Fall 2024?**

**What concentrations and tracks are offered?**

**What programming languages will I learn?**

**What kind of computer should I bring?**

Consistent with our campus-wide [Hardware Specifications](https://www.utsa.edu/techsolutions/students/hardware/) guidance, the university---and the Computer Science Department---provide ample computing resources on campus. Bringing your own computer is optional.

Of course, if you do have your own computer, you can use it on campus.

Any of the major operating systems will be fine for your work in Computer Science---Windows, Mac, or Linux.

If there is one recommendation, it would be to have a machine that supports the use of virtual machines. This would suggest at least 16 GB of RAM.

**How will I be supported with academic advising?**

**How can I get academic credit for an internship?**
