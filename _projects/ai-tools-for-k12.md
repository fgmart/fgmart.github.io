As part of the [AI-CARING NSF Institute](https://ai-caring.org), we
are developing a set of interactive tools to introduce novice
learners to ideas in AI.

### Ice Cream Express
![]({{
 "/assets/img/aitools/ice-cream-express.png"}}){:style="height:180px"}

Ice Cream Express was developed by Nicole Tian and Devansh Shah in the
Developing AI Tools for K-12 course at UTSA (Fall 2025). This tool
scaffolds the A* search algorithm for K-12 learners through an ice
cream delivery game, where users are motivated to find the shortest
path to maximize tips. The bot's delivery visualizes the A* search and
reveals heuristic logic. The tool also captures real-time telemetry
and state logging for each user.

### AI Hoops
![]({{
 "/assets/img/aitools/ai-hoops.png"}}){:style="height:200px"}

AI Hoops was developed by Nicole Tian and Chris Arellano in the
Developing AI Tools for K-12 course at UTSA (Fall 2025). This tool
teaches Q-Learning through an interactive basketball game played with
an AI bot. It visualizes the bot's training process by displaying
real-time Q-Table updates. Additionally, the tool captures telemetry
and state logging to facilitate user analysis.

### Into The Rabbit Hole

![]({{
 "/assets/img/aitools/into-the-rabbit-hole.png"}}){:style="height:150px"}

Into The Rabbit Hole was developed by UTSA undergraduate Durga
Rajarajan in Fall 2024. It introduces the concepts of depth-first
search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) via a game of helping a
rabbit find carrots in a maze. It starts with a tutorial and then has
a game mode where you have to solve as many DFS and BFS puzzles as
possible in the time allotted. [IntoTheRabbitHole: A Web Application
for Teaching Middle School Students About Search
Algorithms](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3724363.3729080) was
presented at ITiCSE 2025 and was nominated for a Best Paper award.

### FaunaForest

![]({{
 "/assets/img/aitools/fauna-forest.png"}}){:style="height:150px"}

FaunaForest was created by Pragathi Durga Rajarajan and Adrian
Cisneros as part of the [Spring 2024 Developing AI Tools for
K-12](../../teaching/DevelopingAITools/) course at UTSA.

FaunaForest aims to teach K-12 students about decision trees via three
levels of interactive decision tree puzzles. Each puzzle involves
completing a decision tree that has blank mystery nodes in such a way
that it will correctly classify various animals. [FaunaForest: A Novel
Software Tool for Teaching Decision Trees to Middle School
Students](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11147419) was presented
at the 2025 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC).

### DoodleIt

![]({{
 "/assets/img/publication_preview/doodleit.png"}}){:style="height:150px"}

Taking inspiration from Google's [Quick,
Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) demo, Vaishali Mahipal (MS
in CS, 2022) led the development of
DoodleIt, a browser-based tool that
demonstrates how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) perform image
recognition.

DoodleIt was presented as a [poster at SIGCSE
'23](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14X3tlSGPwgSf_RMmYygnPqCjGEXMvyPY/present)
and a [paper at ACE '23](/assets/pdf/3576123.3576127.pdf).  Here are
[worksheets for the hands-on kernel filter
activities](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B0SiX3ol50j0p_C1AdLlewe_aHqUSyNK)
we created as part of developing the tool.

link](https://tinyurl.com/mydoodleit).

### ChemAIstry

![]({{
 "/assets/img/aitools/chemaistry.jpg"}}){:style="height:150px"}

ChemAIstry is an interactive software tool for children which
demonstrates training and classification in machine learning. Students
select which everyday items are safe to bring into a chemistry lab
(e.g., a lab coat is safe; pizza is not). These selections serve as
training input for a decision tree classifier. After training,
students see how the trained model performs in classifying new
objects.

The software was developed by Garima Jain (BS in CS 2023) and Vaishali
Mahipal (MS in CS 2022) with assistance from Dr. Ismaila Sanusi and
Srija Ghosh (now a computer science student at Cornell University).

ChemAIstry was presented at [SIGCSE
'24](https://sigcse2024.sigcse.org/details/sigcse-ts-2024-Papers-1/181/ChemAIstry-A-Novel-Software-Tool-for-Teaching-Model-Training-in-K-8-Education). Here
is [the paper](/assets/pdf/3626252.3630804.pdf).  Interact with the
[live version!](https://engaging-computing.github.io/ChemAIstry/)


### AI for American Sign Language

![]({{
 "/assets/img/aitools/ai-for-asl.png"}}){:style="height:150px"}

AI for American Sign Language (AI for ASL) teaches children hand
gestures for several letters of the American Sign Language (ASL)
alphabet while introducing them to image recognition and models.

It was developed by James Dimino and Andrew Farrell during a Spring
2023 class at UMass Lowell and adapted for the web by Angela Wang (now
an undergrad in CS at Cornell University) and Ryan Maradiaga
(finishing his BS in CS at UMass Lowell).

Here is a live web link to [AI for
ASL](https://engaging-computing.github.io/AI-for-ASL/SignInterpreter/src/). 

### AI Chef Trainer

![]({{
 "/assets/img/aitools/aicheftrainer-hero.png"}}){:style="height:150px"}

AI Chef Trainer was developed by UTSA Ph.D. candidate Saniya Vahedian
Movahed in Spring 2024. Its goal is to introduce students to key ideas
in machine learning via the engaging task of recipe
recommendation. Students select ingredients to see what recipes are
predicted by the AI Chef; then they enter their own recipes
(retraining the AI) and then test to see how their recipes can then be
recommended by the AI Chef. [AI Chef Trainer: Introducing Students to
the Importance of Data in Machine
Learning](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/35196/37351)
was presented at the Educational Advances in AI symposium at AAAI
2025.

### Ask Me Anything

![]({{
 "/assets/img/aitools/ask-me-anything.png"}}){:style="height:150px"}

Ask Me Anything (AMA) is a specialized chatbot that answers only
topic-specific questions in three areas&#151;astronomy, sneakers and shoes,
and dinosaurs.

AMA was developed by UTSA Ph.D. candidate Saniya Vahedian Movahed
(with UMass Lowell undergraduate Erika Salas) and is being used to
study children's attitudes of trust and confidence in AI chatbots.

Results from the study using AMA are published the article [Ask Me
Anything: Exploring Children’s Attitudes Toward an Age-tailored
AI-powered
Chatbot](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40593-025-00523-4)

Education</em>.
