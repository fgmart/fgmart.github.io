As part of the [AI-CARING NSF Institute](https://ai-caring.org), we
are developing a set of interactive tools to introduce novice
learners to ideas in AI.

### DoodleIt

Taking inspiration from Google's [Quick,
Draw!](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) demo, Vaishali Mahipal (MS
in CS, 2022) led the development of
DoodleIt, a browser-based tool that
demonstrates how Concurrent Neural Networks (CNNs) perform image
recognition.

DoodleIt was presented as a [poster at SIGCSE
'23](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14X3tlSGPwgSf_RMmYygnPqCjGEXMvyPY/present)
and a [paper at ACE '23](/assets/pdf/3576123.3576127.pdf).  Here are
[worksheets for the hands-on kernel filter
activities](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B0SiX3ol50j0p_C1AdLlewe_aHqUSyNK)
we created as part of developing the tool.

You can interact with DoodleIt at this [live web
link](https://tinyurl.com/mydoodleit).

### ChemAIstry

ChemAIstry is an interactive software tool for children which
demonstrates training and classification in machine learning. Students
select which everyday items are safe to bring into a chemistry lab
(e.g., a lab coat is safe; pizza is not). These selections serve as
training input for a decision tree classifier. After training,
students see how the trained model performs in classifying new
objects.

The software was developed by Garima Jain (BS in CS 2023) and Vaishali
Mahipal (MS in CS 2022) with assistance from Dr. Ismaila Sanusi and
Srija Ghosh (now a computer science student at Cornell University).

ChemAIstry has a full paper presentation at [SIGCSE '24](https://sigcse2024.sigcse.org/details/sigcse-ts-2024-Papers-1/181/ChemAIstry-A-Novel-Software-Tool-for-Teaching-Model-Training-in-K-8-Education).

### Ask Me Anything

Ask Me Anything (AMA) is a specialized chatbot that answers only
topic-specific questions in three areas&#151;astronomy, sneakers and shoes,
and dinosaurs.

AMA was developed by UTSA Ph.D. candidate Saniya Vahedian Movahed
(with UMass Lowell undergraduate Erika Salas) and is being used to
study children's attitudes of trust and confidence in AI chatbots.

It will be presented SIGCSE '24 in a poster entitled [Perception,
Trust, Attitudes, and Models: Introducing Children to AI and Machine Learning with Five Software Exhibits](https://sigcse2024.sigcse.org/track/sigcse-ts-2024-posters#program).


### AI for American Sign Language

![]({{
 "/assets/img/aitools/ai-for-asl.png"}}){:style="height:150px"}

AI for American Sign Language (AI for ASL) teaches children hand
gestures for several letters of the American Sign Language (ASL)
alphabet while introducing them to image recognition and models.

It was developed by James Dimino and Andrew Farrell during a Spring
2023 class at UMass Lowell and adapted for the web by Angela Wang (now
an undergrad in CS at Cornell University) and Ryan Maradiaga
(finishing his BS in CS at UMass Lowell).

Here is a live web link to [AI for
ASL](https://engaging-computing.github.io/AI-for-ASL/SignInterpreter/src/).
