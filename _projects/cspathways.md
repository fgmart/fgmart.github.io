CS Pathways was a researcher-practitioner partnership among two
universities (UMass Lowell and the University at Albany / SUNY) and
three public school districts: Lowell Public Schools (Massachusetts),
Methuen Public Schools (Massachusetts), and Schenectady City Schools
(New York).

The project built culturally sustaining computing programs in middle
school based on students engaging in app design for social good. It
was led by PIs Fred Martin (UMass Lowell and then UT San Antonio) and
Lijun Ni (University at Albany / SUNY) from 2019 to 2024 with awards
from NSF's CSforAll program.

In addition to the research products listed below, we have the CS
Pathways [project web site](https://cspathways.org) and curriculum
site&#151;a [tech
pathway](https://sites.google.com/methuen.k12.ma.us/cspathways/tech-pathway)
and [civics & CS
pathway](https://sites.google.com/methuen.k12.ma.us/cspathways/civics-cs-pathway). See
more materials produced from the project and an earlier collaboration
funded by NSF ITEST [here](https://cspathways.org/publications/).
