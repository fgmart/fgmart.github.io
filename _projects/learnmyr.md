LearnMYR is a programming environment where you can make virtual
reality scenes. It runs in the browser, including on phones, so you
can easily use your phone as a VR headset with an inexpensive Google
Cardboard-style viewer.

The MYR language is JavaScript with a custom API built on top of the
A-Frame web framework.

We've used LearnMYR with beginning and experienced programmers from middle school through university. A research study indicated that beginning programmers may develop enhanced spatial reasoning skills after building projects in MYR.
