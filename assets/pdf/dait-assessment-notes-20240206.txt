How do we measure student learning?

Pre/post surveys (tests)

activities - how they completed; much they understood the concepts
ask them questions about the activities - pre/post surveys
observation
  how fast do they complete the assessment
  how comfortable are they explaining what they did

game - get points - they would be a quantitative measure; if they get more points, it means they understand it better

random forest - building decision trees - evaluating correctness (or some other properties) of the trees that they make

choose your own adventure
adaptive learning questioning
MC with right answers and answers that are close

MC is more likely to get responses than open-ended
MC reveals the intent of the questioner

open-ended - then what do we do with the data?

more likely to get good answers with interviews
can use Zoom; auto-transcribe

screen-recording
audio-recording through Zoom
post-survey: MC and open
behavioral observations from recordings
small groups of students - talking to each other

structured interview

5 to 10 minutes including interaction with sw and conversation

low-level gesture capture (into own DB)

need to think through how to gather (and keep) this data - e.g. own computer; client-server model where we own the server.
