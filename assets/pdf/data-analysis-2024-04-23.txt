Pre-survey

Fred will share aggregate school race/ethnography and gender data (so no need to code up students' answers - we'll assume we have a representative sample of the overall school population).

Fred will make coding table where I create ID for firstname lastname and replace answers with code.

Then Fred will share full raw data with you all.

Task of de-identifying data: removing firstname/lastname (or initial) + grade identifiers from your local copies.

Main task: making of what happened - how did the students use your system; what can you reveal about this usage by analyzing your data.

What are some questions you can ask about your data?

Looking at usage data vs. post-survey data

E.g. for Sam/Matt's project - how well did they do on the mystery section; relate to time invested in project; to post-survey

Saniya: lots of responses to post-survey (open-ended)

Cesar: also most interesting will be post-survey

Matthew: will it be interesting to write about design process of tool and challenges they faced using the tool?

Yes: reflecting on things that worked and things that could be better, based on your observations.

Ian: reflections on what we observed when students were using the SW.

Matthew: students who were in pairs engaged / interacted with it more than students who worked individually.


Saniya's open-ended results - very encouraging.

Coding the responses: classifying the replies. E.g. identify six categories (fun/cool, accurate). For open-ended or observational data.
